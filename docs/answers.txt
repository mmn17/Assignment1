    The master branch should represent the stable history
    of a code.
    (I) One of the reasons why programmers use branches is to experiment 
        new features, implement them, and when they're fully ready 
        merge them back to the master branch.
    (II)Another reason is that they use branches so development can occur 
        without a fear that the program being currupted. Also branches
        are used as a way to organize and separate a branch for each 
        developed feature.

(e)
    - git log shows the the list of all commits for the remote repository.
    - git status compare the state of your local repository with the remote
      repository.

(f)
    git log --follow Weapon.h 

(g)
    git log --grep=file

(h)
    - Inheritance is when a class inherits properties like variables or functions 
      from another class, also refer to as parent class.
    - Polymorphism is when parent type reference variable is use to refer to a 
      child object.
    - Encapsulation is when access to object's data is prevented unless through an 
      approved function calls.

(i)
    - In Dictator and Lieutenants workflow only one central repository is use where 
      one or two Dictator checks everyones work and then push them to the central 
      repository. 
    - In Integration management workflow allow each developer to have his own public
      repository where he/she push and pull from.

(j)
    The Dictator and Lieutenants workflow will minimizes the chaos of pushing/pulling
    because their work is being checked (frequently) little by little by Dictator. 
    while in centralized workflow it can become hard and stressing to continuously 
    checking if other developers work affect your work everytime, as everyone can
    make changes to files.
